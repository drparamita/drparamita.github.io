Welcome! I am **Paramita Dasgupta**, an Astrophysicist and CCAPP Fellow at [The Ohio State University](https://ccapp.osu.edu). I received my PhD from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Pankaj Jain](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~pkjain/home.html).  

My research focuses on ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays, particularly through radio-based detector design, calibration, simulation, and data analysis—including applications of machine learning.  

I developed a pioneering framework to simulate cosmic ray–induced radio signal reflections off Antarctic ice, now employed in NASA-funded missions such as [ANITA](https://anita.bartol.udel.edu/), [HiCal](https://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~anita/hical.html), and the upcoming [PUEO](https://pueo.ps.uci.edu/). I am also an honorary investigator with the [GRAPES-3 collaboration](https://www.tifr.res.in/~grapes/) and have field experience deploying antennas at [Summit Station, Greenland](https://www.geosummit.org/).  

My broader interests span **Fast Radio Bursts**, radio emission from neutron stars, the development of data-driven surface roughness models for dielectric media, and the search for technosignatures.
