Welcome! I am Paramita Dasgupta, an Astrophysicist and CCAPP Fellow at The Ohio State University. I study ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays, with a focus on radio-based detector design, calibration, simulation, and data analysis—including applications of machine learning.
I developed a pioneering framework to simulate cosmic ray–induced radio signal reflections off Antarctic ice, used in NASA-funded missions such as ANITA, HiCal, and the upcoming PUEO. I am also an honorary investigator with the GRAPES-3 collaboration and have hands-on field experience deploying antennas at Summit Station, Greenland.
My broader research interests include Fast Radio Bursts, radio emission from neutron stars, and the search for technosignatures.
