Welcome! I am **Paramita Dasgupta**, an Astrophysicist and CCAPP Fellow at [The Ohio State University](https://ccapp.osu.edu/people/dasgupta.80). I I earned my PhD in Physics from IIT Kanpur [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Pankaj Jain](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~pkjain/home.html). Before joining OSU in January 2024, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)] (https://www.ulb.be/en/ulb-homepage) and the Inter-University Institute for High Energies (IIHE), Brussels, Belgium (2020–2023).

My research focuses on ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays, particularly through radio-based detector design, calibration, simulation, and data analysis including applications of machine learning. 

During my PhD at IIT Kanpur, I developed first rigorous framework based on first principle calculations to simulate cosmic ray–induced radio signal reflections off Antarctic ice, now employed in NASA-funded missions such as [ANITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Impulsive_Transient_Antenna), [HiCal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08909), and the upcoming [PUEO](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/pueo.html) mission. I am also an honorary investigator with the [GRAPES-3 collaboration](https://www.tifr.res.in/~grapes/) and have field experience deploying antennas at [Summit Station, Greenland](https://www.geosummit.org/).  

My broader interests span Fast Radio Bursts, radio emission from neutron stars, the development of data-driven surface roughness models for dielectric media, and the search for technosignatures.
